#DEFINITIONS OF ALL BEHAVIOURS

1.	Find Object
	Precondition:  Nao has initialised
	StopCondition: Object found
	Description: Look left 180 degrees, take picture and find blob.
		Note: test on different positions of the table, mix the behaviour 1. go towards the corner 2. walk sideways to corner
		Go to V position the rotate to the angle
		###to determine if the Nao is in front or behind the table,  find the nao head and scan the y axis below it. If you 
		##finf blue then nao is behind table , else it is in front of table
		## v state of corner
		##at v corner then look left then right and correct for horizontal and distance until left and right are equal
		##when lifting keep table on elbow tot he side
		## nao should adjust to the speed of the other Nao
		-have a behaviour for random walk
-subsumption architecture (behavioir based robotics) - behaviour co-ordination

2.	Move to closest corner of object
	Precondition:   Object seen
	StopCondition: Object bottom  point is greater than 420 pixels(Y)/480 pixels of top camera 

3.	Face centre of Object
	Precondition:  Object is close enough i.e > 420 pixels of top camera
	StopCondition: Whole object can be seen from top camera

4.	Align to longer side of Object
	Precondition:  Whole object can be seen and turn angle/ distance can be calculated usign rotated rectangle
	StopCondition: Move and turn to align 90 degrees with the object

5.	Walk to within lift range of Object
	Precondition:  Robot is aligned with object
	StopCondition: Walk until object is greater than 420 pixels(Y) on the bottom camera

6.	Wait for second Nao Object
	Precondition:  First Nao is in "Seek help mode" (both hand are horixontal to the side and straight)
	StopCondition: Second Nao is in front

7.	Lift and move Object
	Precondition:  Both Naos aligned to object
	StopCondition: Nao have moved table 1 metre to the right
