To add a new Nao robot with the naoqisim controller, here is how to proceed:

1. open the nao.wbt world file
2. stop the simulation (if not already stopped) and revert the world file
3. select the Nao robot in the scene tree
4. create a new Nao robot from the (+) button and select the PROTO (Webots) -> aldebaran -> Nao
5. move the new Nao robot (either change its translation field in the scene tree or moving it using the mouse)
6. open the new Nao node in the scene tree
7. select the controller field of this node
8. replace "nao_demo" with "naoqisim"
9. be sure set the correct port number in "controllerArgs"
10. save the world file with a different name, e.g., nao_2.wbt
11. revert and run the simulation
